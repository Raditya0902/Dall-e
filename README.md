# DALL-E Image Rendering Website

Welcome to our DALL-E Image Rendering Website! This project utilizes the DALL-E (Differentiable Autoregressive Autoencoder with Locally Linear Embeddings) API to generate images based on text prompts provided by users. The generated images are then rendered onto the webpage, allowing users to see the results of their prompts.

## Features

- **DALL-E API Integration**: Utilizes the DALLE API to generate images from text prompts.
- **Image Rendering**: Renders generated images directly onto the webpage.
- **Community Showcase**: Provides a community showcase where users can view generated images along with the corresponding prompt and user name.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies.
3. Run the application.
4. Visit the website and input a text prompt.

## Community Showcase
